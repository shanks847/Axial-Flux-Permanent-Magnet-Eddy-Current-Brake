Some comparisons with the appropriate United States federal standards have been included and the European method of type approval is explained against the background of self-certification in the United States. Several new European proposals for tractor/trailer compatibility, brake apportioning, and antiskid systems are reviewed to illustrate the current status of legislative progress in Europe.},
